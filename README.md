# About

Cryptophane is an easy-to-use Windows application that works with GnuPG (a PGP-compatible encryption program.) It allows users to encrypt, sign, decrypt, and perform key maintenance without having to deal with GnuPG's command-line interface.

# Introduction

The Cryptophane project is currently written in Delphi. You can build it using the free Turbo Delphi.

# Details
